Sets up subnets across two availability zones:
Public subnet: for the presentation layer.
Private subnet: for the application and database layers.
Database subnet: specifically for hosting the database instances.
EC2 Instance Deployment:

Launches EC2 instances in the public and private subnets across two availability zones:
Public subnet: for hosting the presentation layer.
Private subnet: for hosting the application layer.
Database subnet: for hosting the database layer.
Autoscaling Group Setup:

Configures an autoscaling group specifically for the EC2 instances in the private subnets to ensure high availability and scalability of the application layer.
